# Soft Cube Falls and Bounces off the Ground

### Introduction

In this mini project, we simulate a soft cube falling and bouncing off the ground using the [Taichi programming language](https://github.com/taichi-dev/taichi). We implement the Neo-Hookean and Saint Venant-Kirchhoff material models, along with the Explicit Euler and RK4 numerical integration methods. To avoid unnecessary mistake, we use auto diff from taichi to compute force on each vertexes.
